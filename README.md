# Robles-Bot

> Robles-Bot is a discord chat bot built using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) and node.

This is a bot that I created to to mess around with my friends in our Discord server. Robles-Bot can do anything from play music from a YouTube link in your chat channel, to calling a phone and talking with text to speech. I will be adding more commands once I have more free time, but feel free to branch and contribute your own as well!

## Installation

git clone git@github.com:AScriver/robles-bot.git
